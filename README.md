# 🔥 FireRiskAI: AI-Powered Fire Risk Intelligence for National Security  

## 🌍 Midnight GeoHackers – Advancing AI in GEOINT  
We are the **Midnight GeoHackers**, a team of **GEOINT professionals, AI researchers, and national security experts** participating in the **Fire Resilience — Emergency Response & Disaster Recovery Hackathon**, hosted by **Kwaai** and sponsored by **mimik & Personal.ai**.  

🚀 **Our Mission:**  
We are building **FireRiskAI**, an **AI-powered pre-fire risk assessment and community hardening platform** that enhances **GEOINT-driven intelligence** for fire risk prediction, mitigation, and national security applications.  

💡 **Our team includes:**  
- **Ex-NGA & Ex-NSA analysts**  
- **PhDs, MBAs, and advanced-degree professionals** in **geospatial science, AI/ML, cybersecurity, and emergency management**  
- **AI practitioners with deep experience in defense, intelligence, and disaster resilience**  

## 🏛 USGIF, NGA, and National Security Alignment  
We are part of the **USGIF Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Working Group (MLAIWG)**, advancing **AI-driven GEOINT solutions for national security**.  

- **USGIF connects** the **National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)**, the intelligence community, and private defense contractors.  
- **NGA is largely shielded from government budget constraints** impacting agencies like **NOAA, NWS, USGS, and FEMA**, making it well-positioned to expand its GEOINT mission into risk intelligence.  
- As **environmental intelligence agencies face realignments and defunding**, **FireRiskAI provides a scalable AI-driven intelligence solution for pre-fire risk assessment**.  
- We are **presenting a 45-minute session at the USGIF Symposium in May** on **GEOINT’s role in AI-driven risk mitigation**, positioning ourselves as the **thought leaders in AI adoption for GEOINT**.

## 🔥 The Problem: Firestorms Are a National Security Risk  
Wildfires are no longer just environmental disasters—they are national security threats.  
🔥 Fires **disrupt energy grids, military installations, and critical infrastructure**, impacting national defense and economic stability.  
🔥 Most wildfire solutions focus on **detection, suppression, and post-disaster response**—**not prevention and pre-fire mitigation**.  
🔥 Agencies like **NOAA, NWS, and FEMA** face **operational constraints, budget shifts, and reduced capabilities**, creating an intelligence gap in **pre-fire risk assessment**.  

🚀 **FireRiskAI fills this gap with AI-powered risk intelligence, GEOINT automation, and edge AI capabilities.**
