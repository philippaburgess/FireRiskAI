## 🔥 The Problem: Firestorms Are a National Security Risk  
Wildfires are no longer just environmental disasters—they are national security threats.  
🔥 Fires **disrupt energy grids, military installations, and critical infrastructure**, impacting national defense and economic stability.  
🔥 Most wildfire solutions focus on **detection, suppression, and post-disaster response**—**not prevention and pre-fire mitigation**.  
🔥 Agencies like **NOAA, NWS, and FEMA** face **operational constraints, budget shifts, and reduced capabilities**, creating an intelligence gap in **pre-fire risk assessment**.  

🚀 **FireRiskAI fills this gap with AI-powered risk intelligence, GEOINT automation, and edge AI capabilities.**
