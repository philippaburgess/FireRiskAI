🔥 FireRiskAI: AI-Powered Fire Risk Intelligence for National Security & Infrastructure Resilience
🚨 The Problem: Extreme Weather & Fire Displacement Are National Security Threats
Wildfires, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events are increasing in severity and frequency, creating risks not just for communities but for critical infrastructure, energy grids, defense operations, and national security. Firestorms displace thousands of people, disrupt power supplies, damage military installations, and create intelligence gaps in geospatial monitoring, making climate-driven disasters a national security challenge.

At the same time, the U.S. is experiencing shifts in fire intelligence capabilities due to:

Federal agency budget cuts & restructuring – NOAA, NWS, FEMA, and USGS have faced resource limitations, leading to data availability challenges.
Mass displacement of citizens – Wildfires and extreme weather events force tens of thousands of Americans to relocate every year, straining emergency response systems, local economies, and social stability.
Increased reliance on commercial and open-source intelligence (OSINT) – The intelligence community (IC) and emergency planners must integrate private and public geospatial sources into their decision-making.
The stability of NGA & the role of GEOINT – While many agencies are shrinking, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) remains a stable leader in geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), ensuring the U.S. maintains its intelligence advantage in fire risk and disaster resilience.
🔥 FireRiskAI is designed to strengthen the use of AI-powered GEOINT in national security and disaster resilience.

🌍 What Is GEOINT & Why Does It Matter?
Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) is the use of satellite imagery, aerial reconnaissance, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing technologies to analyze the earth’s surface for defense, security, and disaster response applications.

🔹 The Role of the NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency)
NGA is the U.S. government’s premier agency for GEOINT, responsible for mapping and intelligence gathering for national security. It supports the military, intelligence community, and emergency responders with geospatial insights.

NGA provides classified and open-source intelligence to track risks, including wildfires, floods, and environmental threats.
GEOINT is critical for national security, from monitoring troop movements to analyzing wildfire damage on military installations.
🔹 The Role of USGIF (United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation)
USGIF is a public-private partnership advancing the use of GEOINT in government, academia, and industry. It provides:

Research & policy recommendations on GEOINT applications.
Training & workforce development in geospatial technology.
Industry partnerships to expand innovation in geospatial intelligence.
🔥 FireRiskAI is being developed within this GEOINT framework, created with the advisement and collaboration of the USGIF Machine Learning & AI Working Group.

🚀 The Solution: FireRiskAI – A GEOINT-Driven Fire Risk Intelligence Platform
FireRiskAI is a fire risk intelligence platform that integrates geospatial data, machine learning, and agent-based AI to:

✔ Identify high-risk fire zones before ignition
✔ Equip government agencies and businesses with fire risk intelligence
✔ Support national security by strengthening GEOINT capabilities
✔ Assess population displacement risks and inform strategic planning
✔ Provide a hybrid open-access & enterprise-tiered solution for government & industry

🎯 What Is FireRiskAI?
FireRiskAI is a cloud-based analytics platform that provides fire risk intelligence via:

✅ A Web Dashboard – Interactive fire risk mapping & data visualization
✅ An API – Fire risk intelligence that can integrate with government & enterprise systems
✅ AI Models & Reports – AI-powered fire risk assessments & decision support tools

🔥 FireRiskAI is not a real-time fire detection tool. Instead, it focuses on pre-fire risk assessment and strategic planning to help governments and businesses mitigate risk before fires occur.

🔥 New Advances in European Weather Prediction Can Improve Fire Risk Forecasting: The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has introduced a new AI-powered 15-day weather model that improves high-impact weather forecasting, including wind modeling and extreme fire risk conditions. FireRiskAI can integrate these enhanced forecasts to refine fire risk predictions, improving early warning and preparedness.
