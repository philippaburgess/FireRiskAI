# 🔥 FireRiskAI: AI-Powered Fire Risk Intelligence for National Security  

## 🌍 Midnight GeoHackers – Advancing AI in GEOINT  
We are the **Midnight GeoHackers**, a team of **GEOINT professionals, AI researchers, and national security experts** participating in the **Fire Resilience — Emergency Response & Disaster Recovery Hackathon**, hosted by **Kwaai** and sponsored by **mimik & Personal.ai**.  

🚀 **Our Mission:**  
We are building **FireRiskAI**, an **AI-powered pre-fire risk assessment and community hardening platform** that enhances **GEOINT-driven intelligence** for fire risk prediction, mitigation, and national security applications.  

💡 **How Our Team Came Together:**  
Our team consists of **ex-NGA & ex-NSA analysts, PhDs, MBAs, and advanced-degree professionals** in **geospatial science, AI/ML, cybersecurity, and emergency management**. We are united by a shared commitment to **advancing GEOINT AI solutions** and leveraging **fire risk intelligence as a case study for broader GEOINT innovation.**  

### **🏛 USGIF: What It Is & Why It Matters**  
The **United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF)** is the leading organization for advancing **geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) innovation, education, and collaboration** between government agencies, private defense contractors, and technology leaders.  

- **USGIF provides a critical link between NGA, DoD, DHS, and private industry**, fostering cutting-edge research and national security applications.  
- **As members of the USGIF Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Working Group (MLAIWG), we are actively shaping the future of AI adoption in GEOINT.**  
- **Our FireRiskAI project serves as a proof of concept for how AI-powered GEOINT solutions can enhance risk intelligence, automation, and decision support.**  

🔥 **We will be presenting a 45-minute session at the USGIF Symposium in May** to showcase **GEOINT’s role in AI-driven risk mitigation** and establish **FireRiskAI as a leading example of AI adoption in geospatial intelligence.**

## 🔥 The Problem: Firestorms Are a National Security Risk  
Wildfires are no longer just environmental disasters—they are national security threats.  
🔥 Fires **disrupt energy grids, military installations, and critical infrastructure**, impacting national defense and economic stability.  
🔥 Most wildfire solutions focus on **detection, suppression, and post-disaster response**—**not prevention and pre-fire mitigation**.  
🔥 Agencies like **NOAA, NWS, and FEMA** face **operational constraints, budget shifts, and reduced capabilities**, creating an intelligence gap in **pre-fire risk assessment**.  

🚀 **FireRiskAI fills this gap with AI-powered risk intelligence, GEOINT automation, and edge AI capabilities.**

## 🌪 Integrating 15-Day Weather Forecasts for Fire Risk Intelligence  
Accurate **wind forecasts** are essential for predicting wildfire spread.  
- **The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)** recently introduced an AI system that improves **15-day weather predictions** by 20%, including **wind modeling and extreme weather forecasting**.  
- **DeepMind's GenCast AI** outperforms traditional models in predicting high-wind events and tropical cyclones, **helping anticipate fire risk with greater precision**.  

### 🔹 Why Wind Forecasts Matter for FireRiskAI  
✅ **Fire Spread:** Wind direction and speed determine how fast and where a fire moves.  
✅ **Fire Intensity:** Strong winds increase oxygen supply, making fires burn hotter and faster.  
✅ **Spotting:** Wind carries embers that ignite new fires **miles away from the main blaze**.  

By incorporating **15-day wind forecasts from ECMWF & AI-driven weather models**, **FireRiskAI enhances predictive accuracy, optimizes firefighting resource allocation, and improves early warnings**.
